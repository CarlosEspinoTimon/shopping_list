# WEB SCRAPERS
At the moment there is just one web scraper for one supermarket. 

## Run the scrapper
To run the scrapper you need to have installed the python 2.7 with the module [Beautiful Soup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
Then, you have to run the carrefour.py program.
```python carrefour.py```

This scraper will comunicate with the server, so it has to be up and running.
